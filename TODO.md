1. Test that the changes made to `useBoxedState` work
   - I'm trying to make use of `internalState` instead of manually updating the box's value all the time.
   - Maybe the box should also be held as state? I think updating the internal state is enough for React, but I should test this to be sure

2. Replace `fetchLegalMoves` with a call to fetch the available moves for a specific piece
   - This will probably involve bigger changes to the way the board state is held in the `Board` component. Ideally I can remove the big board object entirely :)

3. Figure out how I'm going to fix the type system :P
   - Macro to generate a type guard from an enum / struct?
      - Reimplement the TS type generation macro as is
      - Send a type guard in the event generated by a new rust macro that is called on the response we recieved
         - not going to work since typescript type checks at compile time, not runtime. any type guard generated at run time will be pointless, unless we premake type guards for every type and use the relevant one?

   for a solution which moves the send function into the request object, avoiding the type information being lost. It relies on the generated Sendable class code to know its own name for the send function, which should be achievable with a macro.

4. Remove `wasm-bindgen` as a dependency, it's bloating the project unnecessarily
   - This should happen when the typing issues are resolved, as making my own macro seems to be the best way forward, and I can avoid using it as a dependency
